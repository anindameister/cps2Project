# What is OPC UA? [[1]](#1)

- OPC UA is a unified architecture of information exchange for industrial communications 
    - particularly on devices 
        - within machines, 
        - between machines 
        - and from machines to systems 
            - in the convergence of IT and OT.
- OPC UA can be used with any software platforms like
    - Windows 
    - Linux
    - Mac
    - Android
- OPC UA being able to be used with any software platforms, makes it scalable from 
    - minimum embedded controllers to
        
        - massive cloud infrastructures and 
        - even mobile devices.

- OPC UA is equally suited over 
    - closed network
    - or utilised via the internet

- Security is baked into the protocol for 
    - access control
    - authentications
    - and encryption

- OPC UA is flexible
    - so, it has been adopted in industries 
        - like automative
        - beverage
        - oil and gas
        - energy and utilities
        - packaging
        - building automation and many more

- From the above points, we see that
    - manufacturing moves into 
        - IIOT, Industries 4.0 realm
            - The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology.
    - OPC UA is already poised to fulfill the requirements such as 
        - Vendor Independent
        - Scalable
        - Secure
        - Information Modelling
        - Discovery
        - Semantic Data
        - standardised
