# What is OPC UA? [[1]](#1)
- **OPC UA (short for Open Platform Communications United Architecture) is a data exchange standard for industrial communication (machine-to-machine or PC-to-machine communication).**
- OPC UA is a unified architecture of information exchange for industrial communications 
    - particularly on devices 
        - within machines, 
        - between machines 
        - and from machines to systems 
            - in the convergence of IT and OT.
- OPC UA can be used with any software platforms like
    - Windows 
    - Linux
    - Mac
    - Android
- OPC UA being able to be used with any software platforms, makes it scalable from 
    - minimum embedded controllers to
        
        - massive cloud infrastructures and 
        - even mobile devices.

- OPC UA is equally suited over 
    - closed network
    - or utilised via the internet

- Security is baked into the protocol for 
    - access control
    - authentications
    - and encryption

- OPC UA is flexible
    - so, it has been adopted in industries 
        - like automative
        - beverage
        - oil and gas
        - energy and utilities
        - packaging
        - building automation and many more

- From the above points, we see that
    - manufacturing moves into 
        - IIOT, Industries 4.0 realm
            - The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology.
    - OPC UA is already poised to fulfill the requirements such as 
        - Vendor Independent
        - Scalable
        - Secure
        - Information Modelling
        - Discovery
        - Semantic Data
        - standardised


# Why We Need VDMA OPC UA Companion Specification! [[2]](#2)

- Together with Mechanical Engineering Companies,
    - the VDMA is developing
        - OPC UA's
            - companion specifications
                - question is why?

- OPC UA allows engineers               
    - a platform independent
    - interoperable
    - and vendor independent integration of 
        - different machines in production

- VDMA represents 
    - more than 3200 member companies 
    - and is the voice of the mechanical engineering industry in Europe

- VDMA supports manufacturers in developing
    - OPC UA companion specifications like 
        - platform independence
        - interoperability
        - vendor independence 
    which ensures 
        - smooth Industry 4.0 communications
        - Industry 4.0 communications is ensured between 
            - both machines and 
            - from machines 
                - to other systems
                    - which leads to more efficient production.
                    - For engineers, this results in the Industry 4.0 application fields
                        - of plug and play/work
                        - condition monitoring
                        - predictive maintainence 
                        - and OEE improvements.
                            - What Is OEE? OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is a “best practices” metric that identifies the percentage of planned production time that is truly productive. An OEE score of 100% represents perfect production: manufacturing only good parts, as fast as possible, with no downtime.

- **OPC UA Companion Specifications defines the form in which machine provides certain informations**, which makes
    - **integrating** the machines into an existing production environment
    - and **configuring** the machines much easy
        - which in turn makes enginners' work, much more efficient
        - That's how Industry 4.0 works
